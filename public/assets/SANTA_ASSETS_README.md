# Santa Assets

To enable the Christmas/Santa tracker mode, you need to add the following asset:

## Required Asset

- `santa-sleigh-100.png` - A 100x100 pixel image of Santa in his sleigh

## Asset Placement

Place the Santa sleigh image in this directory (`public/assets/`) with the filename:
- `santa-sleigh-100.png`

## Recommended Sources

You can find free Santa/sleigh images at:
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) - Search for "Santa sleigh"
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - Search for "Santa Claus"
- [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) - Search for "Santa"

Make sure the image has a transparent background and is approximately 100x100 pixels for best results.

## Building with Christmas Mode

Once the asset is in place, you can build the Christmas version:

```bash
npm run build:christmas
```

Or run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev:christmas
```
